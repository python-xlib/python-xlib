*** Necessary for complete X11R6 implementation

* Bitmap support: Drawable.GetImage and Drawable.PutImage must be
  implemented, possibly with support of special fields and optional
  hooks to PIL.


*** Frameworks

* Multi-platform: the X library should be portable to other operating
  systems than Unix (it might even only work with XFree86 if the
  display is ":0" right now).  There are two things which might be OS
  specific: finding out and parsing the display name for establishing
  a connection, and finding authoritative data.

* Thread support: Currently, it would suffice to make the lowlevel
  Xlib.protocol.display.Display thread-safe, as no parts of the
  high-level interface modify shared data.  This should be done in
  such a way that one can still use the library without the thread
  support, for systems where the thread module is missing.

* Extensions:  There should be hooks for adding requests, events,
  errors and high-level methods for X extensions.  Preferably,
  Xlib.display.Display would itself find all extensions supported by
  the server and install corresponding code automatically.


*** To be a real C Xlib replacement

* High-level functions: currently, there are only methods which
  directly correspond to X requests.  Perhaps there should be some
  simpler functions (e.g. Window.resize_window() in addition to
  Window.configure(), Drawable.rectangle() in addition to
  Drawable.poly_rectangle(), etc), and possibly also compound
  functions (e.g. create_pixmap_from_image() which would load an image
  file and create a pixmap of it).

* Events: advanced event queue handling, e.g. filtering out events,
  only process events for a certain window, etc.

* Extensions: as many extensions as possible should be implemented,
  using the yet-to-be-written framework.

* Resource database: an implementation of the Xlib resource database
  must be implemented.


*** Miscellaneous

* Documentation.

* Test suite: a test suite which exercises the entire library would
  definitely be a nice thing to have.

* Porting: the library should be runnable wherever there is a Python
  interpreter (with the necessary IPC support, that is.)  Major
  porting targets are Windows and OpenVMS.

* Widget set: a Python-optimized widget set using the X library would
  be really cute.

* Server-side support: while we're at it, why not extend the library
  to provide at least the server-side parsing of the X protocol?  It
  could be usable for writing X proxies, or for that matter, a
  complete X server in Python (this might be a little too spaced-out,
  though...)
