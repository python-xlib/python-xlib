	* rq.py: The fix for 64-bit platforms didn't work, and close
	scrutiny of structmodule.c shows why: it turns out that '='
	translates into '<' or '>', the one the platform would use.  This
	means B is one byte, H is two and L is four, and no extra
	alignment, always.  '@', which is the default, selects native
	number of bytes, which on Alpha means that 'L' is eight bytes.

	Now the code goes to pains to ensure that '=' encoding is always
	used, so _now_ it should work on all platforms.  Ahem.

	* rq.py: Optimizations:
	  + replace calls to Field.get_name() with access to attribute
	    name. 
	    (Struct.build_from_args):

	* rq.py: Alpha forces us to probe how many bytes each struct code
	in 'bhil' represents, instead of being able to assume that b is 1,
	h is 2 and l is 4.

	* request.py (SetClipRectangles): Fixed typo (attribute was
	"rectangels").

	* rq.py (DictWrapper.__setitem__),
	(DictWrapper.__delitem__),
	(DictWrapper.__setattr__), 
	(DictWrapper.__delattr__): 
	Add a few methods to the DictWrapper, to make sure that even if
	attributes are changed, all attributes can be found in the _data
	mapping.

	(ValueField.__init__): 
	(Object.__init__): 
	(ValueField.pack_value): 
	(Set.__init__): 
	Added a default parameter, so that structure elements with a
	default value can be omitted when calling build_from_args.
