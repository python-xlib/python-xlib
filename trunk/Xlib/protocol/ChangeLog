	* display.py (Display.parse_event_response): Fix bug reported by
	Ilpo Nyyssönen, whereby ReplyRequests which generates events
	(e.g. get_property with delete = 1) will get dropped when the
	event is received.

2001-12-14  Peter Liljenberg  <peter.liljenberg@esdgkonsult.com>

	* display.py (Display.parse_event_response): 
	* rq.py (Event.__init__): Fixed bug in event type decoding: bit
	0-6 is the event type, and bit 7 is set if the event was sent by
	SendEvent. 
	

2001-01-16    <petli@cendio.se>

	* event.py: Changed some class names so that they correspond
	exactly to the event type constants.

	* display.py (Display.send_request): Fixed a call to append() with
	multiple arguments, something that modern Pythons don't allow.
	

2001-01-04    <petli@cendio.se>

	* rq.py: The fix for 64-bit platforms didn't work, and close
	scrutiny of structmodule.c shows why: it turns out that '='
	translates into '<' or '>', the one the platform would use.  This
	means B is one byte, H is two and L is four, and no extra
	alignment, always.  '@', which is the default, selects native
	number of bytes, which on Alpha means that 'L' is eight bytes.

	Now the code goes to pains to ensure that '=' encoding is always
	used, so _now_ it should work on all platforms.  Ahem.

	* rq.py: Optimizations:
	  + replace calls to Field.get_name() with access to attribute
	    name. 
	    (Struct.build_from_args): 

Fri Dec 29 17:05:02 2000  Peter Liljenberg  <petli@cendio.se>

	* rq.py: Alpha forces us to probe how many bytes each struct code
	in 'bhil' represents, instead of being able to assume that b is 1,
	h is 2 and l is 4.

2000-12-21    <petli@cendio.se>

	* request.py (SetClipRectangles): Fixed typo (attribute was
	"rectangels"). 

2000-12-20    <petli@cendio.se>

	* rq.py (DictWrapper.__setitem__),
	(DictWrapper.__delitem__),
	(DictWrapper.__setattr__), 
	(DictWrapper.__delattr__): 
	Add a few methods to the DictWrapper, to make sure that even if
	attributes are changed, all attributes can be found in the _data
	mapping.

	(ValueField.__init__): 
	(Object.__init__): 
	(ValueField.pack_value): 
	(Set.__init__): 
	Added a default parameter, so that structure elements with a
	default value can be omitted when calling build_from_args.
