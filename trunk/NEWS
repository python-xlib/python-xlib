* Version 0.6  29 Dec 2000

** Fix to make python-xlib work on 64-bytes architectures.

The struct and array modules uses sizeof(long) to determine the number
of bytes used when representing the type code 'l'.  On Intel and VAX,
this is 32 bits as expected.  On Alpha, it's 64 bits.  python-xlib now
probes how large each type code is to avoid this problem.


* Version 0.5  28 Dec 2000

** Functions implemented to get and set all ICCCM WM properties on
Window objects.

** Keymap cache implemented, with external Xlib.display.Display
methods keycode_to_keysym, keysym_to_keycode, keysym_to_keycodes and
refresh_keyboard_mapping.

** Two utils for debugging X traffic implemented.
utils/tcpbug.py forwards a TCP connection and outputs the
communication between the client and the server.  This output can then
be fed into utils/parsexbug.py, which will output all requests,
responses, errors and events in a readable format.


* Version 0.4  4 Oct 2000

** Thread support completed, but not really stresstested yet.

** A framework for handling different platforms has been implemented,
together with generic Unix code and some simple VMS code.

** Some documentation has been written.

** The usual bunch of bugfixes.
