* Version 0.5

** Functions implemented to get and set all ICCCM WM properties on
Window objects.

** Keymap cache implemented, with external Xlib.display.Display
methods keycode_to_keysym, keysym_to_keycode, keysym_to_keycodes and
refresh_keyboard_mapping.

** Two utils for debugging X traffic implemented.
utils/tcpbug.py forwards a TCP connection and outputs the
communication between the client and the server.  This output can then
be fed into utils/parsexbug.py, which will output all requests,
responses, errors and events in a readable format.


* Version 0.4  4 Oct 2000

** Thread support completed, but not really stresstested yet.

** A framework for handling different platforms has been implemented,
together with generic Unix code and some simple VMS code.

** Some documentation has been written.

** The usual bunch of bugfixes.
