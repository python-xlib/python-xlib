The Python X Library is distributed as a Python package, named
@code{Xlib}.  It contains a number of modules providing the main
library interface:

@table @code

@item display

Contains the @code{Display} class, providing the X connection and access
to all other X objects and operations.

@item error

Contains all @code{Xlib} exception classes.

@item threaded

Imported to set up the library to be thread-safe.

@item rdb

Contains @code{ResourceDB}, an X resource database class, and related
code.

@item X

Contains symbolic names for all basic X protocol constants.

@item Xutil

Contains additional constants for mainly the ICCCM standard.

@item XK

Contains symbolic names for all X keysyms.

@item Xatom

Contains symbolic names for all standard X atoms.

@item Xcursorfont

Contains symbolic names for all standard X fonts.

@end table


There is also a number of subpackages, but they will mainly be of
interest to developers of the Xlib itself:

@table @code

@item protocol

The low-level protocol implementation.  Contains definitions of all X
request, responses, events and errors, in addition to the core network
code.  The high-level object oriented interface provided by
@code{Xlib.display} is merely a wrapper around this package.

@item support

Miscellaneous supporting code for handling threads and operating
system-specific features.

@item xobject

Contains classes for all X objects, which are returned by various
display operations.

@item ext

Contains various X protocol extensions.  Extensions supported by the
server are loaded automatically at the display connection.

@end table
