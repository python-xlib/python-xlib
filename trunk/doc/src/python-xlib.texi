@top Introduction

The Python X Library is a complete library for writing X Windows client
applications in Python.  It implements the entire X11R6 protocol and
some extensions, and also some supplementary functionality such as a
resource database.  It is written entirely in Python, and is therefore
entirely independent of the traditional C Xlib; it only requires a
Python installation with network support.

Although the X11R6 protocol is the basis of all X client applications,
it is a little too low-level to be useful for writing advanced graphical
interfaces.  To this end, many different widget sets has been developed,
a few of the more popular are Motif, Qt and Gtk.  The Python X Library
is not compatible with any of these, as they are based on the C Xlib.
As a result the Python X Library isn't in itself very useful for writing
GUIs, but is eminent for writing small X applications with no advanced
GUI, e.g. simple monitor programs, or for that matter more advanced
background applications such as window managers.
